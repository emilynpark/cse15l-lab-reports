To get to this step, I typed the command `git clone git@github.com:emilynpark/lab7.git` in the terminal. I pressed `<enter>` to run the command.

To demonstrate that the tests contained in `ListExamples.java` fail, I typed the command `bash test.sh` in the terminal. I pressed `<enter>` to run the command.

To edit the code file `ListExamples.java` to fix the error, I first ran the command `cd lab7` to change the working directory to `lab7`. I then typed in `vim ListExamples.java` to directly edit the file.

I first pressed the up arrow/`k` to reach the line containing the error.  I then pressed the right arrow/`l` until my cursor was over the `1` in `index1`, and I pressed `x` to delete the `1`. I proceeded to press `i` to enter the insert mode, and pressed `2` so that the line now contains `index2`. I pressed `<esc>` to exit the insert mode, and then I pressed `:wq` followed by `<enter>` to save my changes.

## Step 8

I returned to the terminal and I ran the command `bash test.sh` to demonstrate that the error has been fixed and the tests now succeed.

## Step 9

I ran the command `git add ListExamples.java` to stage the file in order to commit it to GitHub. To confirm that my changes have been appropriately saved, I ran the command `git status`. I ran the command `git commit -m "Updated file"` to create a brief message stating that the file has been updated. Afterwards, I ran the command `git push git@github.com:emilynpark/lab7.git main` to push the changes to my GitHub account.
